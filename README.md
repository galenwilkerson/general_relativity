Notes for General Relativity at Stanford University by Leonard Susskind

This is a Jupyter notebook designed to accompany Leonard Susskind's Statistical Mechanics course, from the website http://theoreticalminimum.com/courses/general-relativity/2012/fall

I have attempted to write the major mathematical work in Latex, perhaps including some small experiments in Python 3.6. This is designed for you to try experiments out, and to try to clarify the mathematical work/proofs.

Any errors are exercises for the reader! (You learn by doing, not just by reading.)

Enjoy!
